# Implementing Closing the Books With Marten
- How to model processes to keep streams short,
- What's Closing the Books pattern and how it can help in that,
- Practical example showing how to implement it in practice using Marten.
- Examples shows both closing and opening it as the same and separate operations.

Read the explanation of these samples in my article [Implementing Closing the Books With Marten](https://event-driven.io/en/closing_the_books_in_practice/).
